please see the main read me for explanation on what modifications 
you have to do in order to run this.

mainly: download one of the javascript shells, and run the runner and killer with 
the full path to the downloaded//compiled shell.

e.g:

python killer.py C:\\path\\to\\theshell.exe
python run C:\\path\\to\\theshell.exe
